# Evaluation

## Hypothesis

Artists prefer (wrt perceived workload and focusability)
- an incremental rendering method to a denoiser, which updates the whole screen at once, when editing small objects
- a denoiser to an incremental method when editing light sources, as light changes often affect the entire scene
(exploratory evaluation for large objects)

## Study Design

- We evaluated two incremental methods (noisy and denoised) by comparing them to the AI-accelerated Optix Denoiser, which is widely supported in industrial rendering engines and thus familiar to artists.
- consisting of three parts: tutorial, task-based evaluation, general+demographic questions
- Three scenes: bathroom for tutorial, kitchen and living room for task-based evaluation
- Tutorial:
  - bathroom scene
  - four tasks (move single/multiple, change material/light) to explore all needed features of the system
  - Theoretical Background showing videos of 1spp and converged rendering with 4096spp + Optix
- Task-based Evaluation:
  - kitchen and living room scene
  - split into small objects (4 subtasks, 2 transformation, 2 material edits), large objects (3 subtasks, 2 transformation, 1 material edits) and lights (3 subtasks, 2 global, 1 local)
  - standardized Nasa-TLX questionnaire + two own questions assessing focus and distraction
  - changed scale after a small pilot study with four participants as they were confused about compared to what they should rate the methods
  - for incremental methods we asked which rendering parameters (Tile Quality/Size, Threshold) they changed and which settings they preferred
  - random order of the methods switching between Denoiser or Incremental methods (Incremental methods fixed to first noisy then denoised); fixed order of tasks
- General questions:
  - Videos showing all 3 methods again in the bathroom scene, asking overall preference
  - Net Promoter Score like question asking how likely participants would buy the respective rendering method as a feature in a rendering tool
  - Demographic Questions about study population (Experience level of the participants via hours working with rendering applications and categorical student/professional, Age and gender)
  - Which engines they used before and in which field of work; how often they use a path traced rendering view for scene editing and for which reasons not; which denoiser they typically use
- voice/screen recorded, speech-to-text via OpenAIs whisper; participants were asked to voice their thoughts during the study; structured interview at the end (why do they prefer the stated method, future relevance of path tracing in their field of work)
- survey implemented as self-hosted drupal webform
- in person/online (remote controll via parsec or running on own hardware)
